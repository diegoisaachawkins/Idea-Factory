	- ## [[Literature Notes]]
		- Where ideas come from:
			1. Information from others sources (articles, books, podcasts, etc)
				- These are called [[Literature Notes]]
			2. Ideas you come up with 
				- These are called [[Fleeting Notes]]  
		- How to take Literature Notes
			1. When you come across an interesting source of information save it for later using the My Mind app.
			2. Consume the source of information when you have time and take literature notes in your own words
				- Articles + Videos: Takes notes directly in the app unless on the go use drafts
				- Books: take notes with drafts;
				- Podcasts: take notes with drafts -> connected to obsidian
			- 
	
			
	- ## Highlights
		- Ideas come from either A: information you consumed or B: epiphany (e.g. ideas you get while taking a walk, a shower, etc)
		- ### A: Information you consumed (e.g. books, articles, podcasts, tweets etc)
			- Step 1. Take Literature-Notes in your own words
				- 1-3 sentences are enough
			- Step 2. I usually add the tag [[Edit later]] to some of the Literature-Notes if I want to develop them further
			- Step 3. Go to the [[Edit later]] page once a day and polish the ideas more by writing about them and turn them into Evergreen-Notes
				- *Edit later page is like my writing inbox. Whenever I have free time, I open the page and start writing on topics I have on the page. 
		- ### B: Epiphany (e.g. ideas you get while taking a walk, journaling, taking shower etc.)
			- Step 1. Take a note of your idea/thought in your Daily Notes with the tag  [[Fleeting-Notes]]
			- Step 2. Develop the ideas
			- Step 3. When you polished it enough, turn it into an Evergreen-Note
- ## Taking notes from Kindle books 
	- You can import your highlights via [[Readwise]] which is popular among Roam users. But personally, I don't use Readwise. Instead, I use this extension called Roam Highlighter (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-highlighter/mcoimieglmhdjdoplhpcmifgplkbfibp). 
	- Visit https://read.amazon.com/notebook and hit the extension button. And click this 'Get Kindle Highlights', which will pull every highlight for this book automatically. Then you can copy and paste them in your Roam database.

	- I use my [[Resonance Calendar]] template for keeping record of books, articles, videos I consumed. You can copy this template below if you like:
		- Resonance Calendar [[roam/templates]]

	- Paste the highlights under the "Highlights" section. 
	- Start taking literature notes under the "literature notes" section. It's useful to open the "literature note" section in your sidebar while looking at the highlights in the main panel. 
	- After done taking literature notes, make some of them into evergreen notes. 
- ## Taking notes from articles
	- I use an app called [[mymind]] as my idea storage, where I save inspirations and cool ideas. Whenever I see an interesting article, I save it to mymind so I can read it later. 
	- When you have free time, read the article. I use an extension called Eloquent Quick Capture for making highlights ->  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eloquent-highlight-captur/olkmpnafmgcfindlljhgnminkhkfcckl.
	-  Use the resonance calendar template and paste the highlights under the "highlights" section. The process after this is the same for Kindle books. 
-  - Q: What do A: B: E: at the beginning of pages mean?
	- A: 
		- I like to use some syntaxes in Roam. A stands for articles; B stands for books, and E stands for Evergreen notes
		- This helps me quickly find a page I'm looking for. For example, when I want to find an evergreen note about [[Competition]] , I can just type E: competition
